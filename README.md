[00:32.37] I don't know what it is that makes me feel alive
[00:36.32] I don't know, how to wake the things that sleep inside
[00:40.11] I only wanna see the light, that shines behind your eyes
[01:08.11] 
[00:47.81] And there are many things, that I would like to know
[00:51.75] And there, are many places that I wish to go
[00:55.57] But, everything's depending on the way, the wind may blow
[01:24.07] 
[01:06.22] Because, we need each other
[01:10.32] We believe in one another
[01:14.13] And I know, we're going to uncover
[01:17.72] What's sleepin' in our soul
[01:31.22] 
[01:21.57] Because, we need each other
[01:25.53] We believe in one another
[01:29.34] I know, we're going to uncover
[01:32.93] What's sleepin' in our soul
[01:36.88] Sleepin' in our soul
[01:46.88] 
[01:45.36] I don't know what it is, that makes me feel alive
[01:49.20] I don't know, how to wake the things that sleep inside
[01:53.04] I only wanna see the light, that shines behind your eyes
[02:21.04] 
[02:00.90] And there, are many places that I wish to go
[02:04.68] And there are many things, that I would like to know
[02:08.58] But, everything's depending on the way, the wind may fucking blow
[02:41.08] 
[02:19.39] Because, we need each other
[02:23.11] We believe in one another
[02:26.83] And I know, we're going to uncover
[02:30.47] What's sleepin' in our soul
[02:43.97] 
[02:34.36] Because, we need each other
[02:38.36] We believe in one another
[02:42.12] And I know, we're going to uncover
[02:45.85] Sleep within our soul
[02:49.63] Sleeps within our soul
[02:53.47] Sleep within our soul
[02:57.22] Sleep within our soul
[03:07.72] 
[03:01.05] We believe
[03:04.98] What we need
[03:08.73] What we need
[03:12.09] Because we need
[03:19.59] 
[03:30.75] Thank you all, very much
